Application Icon Placeholder
=============================

An application icon (app_icon.ico) should be placed in this directory.

The icon should be:
- Windows ICO format
- Multiple resolutions: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256
- Theme: Forensic/security related (e.g., magnifying glass, checkmark, shield)

Icon creation tools:
- GIMP (Export as .ico)
- IcoFX
- Online converters (PNG to ICO)

Recommended design:
- Simple, recognizable at small sizes
- Professional appearance
- Related to forensic analysis or file verification

For now, the application will run without a custom icon and use the default Windows application icon.
